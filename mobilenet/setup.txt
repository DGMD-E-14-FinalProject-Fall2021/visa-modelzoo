python 3.5 - 3.8

Step 1: Add and create virtual env for tflite
mkdir -p Projects/Python/tflite
cd Projects/Python/tflite
python -m pip install virtualenv
python -m venv tflite-env

Step 2: Activate env
source tflite-env/bin/activate

Step 3: (make sure you are in a venv) Install libraries for imageprocessing
sudo apt -y install libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev

Step 4: 
sudo apt -y install qt4-dev-tools libatlas-base-dev libhdf5-103 

Step 5: install openCV
python -m pip install opencv-contrib-python (if you have issues try version 4.1.0.25 )*
*	opencv-contrib-python==4.1.0.25

Step 6:
Check out your processor and python version:
uname -m
python --version

step 6: Install TF
Open an Internet browser on your Pi and head to tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python. Scroll down to the list of wheel (.whl) files and find the group that matches your OS/processor, which should be “Linux (ARM 32).” In that group, find the link that corresponds to your version of Python (3.7 for me). Right-click and select 

Back in the terminal, enter the following:

python -m pip install <paste in .whl link>

Step 7: Run the webcam object detection script
